# Maakhana_Survey-App
Maakhana is a modern, interactive web application designed to conduct market research for an upcoming home-cooked meal delivery service targeting students and working professionals in Noida and Greater Noida. Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, the app features a high-energy, Gen-Z-friendly interface ("Vibe Check") that replaces traditional boring forms with a conversational user experience.

Key Features:

Dynamic Pricing Engine: A custom logic layer that automatically adjusts the minimum budget slider based on user preferences. Selecting add-ons like "Protein Boost" or "Extra Servings" updates the price floor in real-time.

"Gym Bro" Logic: A specialized premium package toggle that overrides standard options to offer high-protein, lean-cooked meals for fitness enthusiasts.

Seamless Data Collection: Integrated with Firebase Firestore to store survey responses instantly and Firebase Authentication (Anonymous) to ensure secure, frictionless user access without requiring sign-ups.

Responsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile devices, featuring smooth transitions and lucid iconography (lucide-react) to ensure high engagement rates.

This project serves as the digital MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the Maakhana brand, helping validate pricing models and menu demand before operational launch.
